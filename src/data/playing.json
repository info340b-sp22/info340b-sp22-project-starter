    "description": "A theater troupe in Taiwan is staging a production of 'Secret Love,' an exalted drama with overt political overtones, about a man searching for his lost love. Unfortunately, they have to share their practice space with another troupe, which is staging the comedy 'Secret Love for the Peach Blossom Spring.' Each troupe looks down on the other's production, but both groups soon discover that the plays have more in common than they initially realized."
