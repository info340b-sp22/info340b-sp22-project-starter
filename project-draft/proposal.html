  <p>Proposal for a workout recommendation website</p>
  <section>
    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    <p>
      Our goal is to develop a website for fitness, which provides workout recommendations for its
      user and helps the user keep up with the schedule. Workout at home is challenging for several
      reasons.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>People lack knowledge of what to do and how to do it. We are drowning in information.
        We can get millions of answers to anything in nanoseconds. We know that we should exercise,
        but we may not be comfortable trying something we saw in a magazine without some more
        guidance or experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        People don't have a workout goal. This goes beyond the goal of, 'I want to lose weight'.
        This problem arises when you can't answer the following sample questions;
        “What body parts am I going to work on?”, “Am I going to do intervals? If so, what's my
        work to rest ratio going to be today? What was it last week?”, “What did I do last time, and
        do I need to switch things up or stay the same to reach my goals this week/month/etc?”
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Existing attempt to solve this problem includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-fitness-plus/">Apple Fitness Plus</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.sweat.com/">Sweat</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These sites are great, but they are subscription-based. We hope to build a website that
      provides detailed information for people who want to work out at home with only open and
      free resources on the Internet. We hope to help everyone achieve their ideal body shape.
    </p>

    <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
    <p>The website is mainly for users that chase fitness habits. There are a lot of people who
      want to start a fitness or work out. However, they do not know how to start and what to do.
      Because fitness could be potentially dangerous, clarifications about some common
      misconceptions are needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data will be a CSV file and links to professional videos or passages for people to view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The common misconception will place on the website. The website will be divided into different
      sections, and people can click the section to find the body part that they want to work out.
      There will be a calculator for the user to use as a body statue.
    </p>
    <p>The application is basically guidance for people who are just starting to work out or want to
      start a workout. With this guidance, people can just follow the order on the website and
      access the right video to learn the correct knowledge.
